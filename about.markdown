I'm a Data Scientist/Machine Learning Engineer who loves great food, new places to travel, pop music on weekends and also NLP.  
I currently work for CBS Interactive in the Applied Machine Learning Group.  
I love sharing what I have learnt about recent progresses in research, but also how to make them "work" with everything else in a real, complex world.
