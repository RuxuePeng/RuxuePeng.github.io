I'm a Data Scientist/Machine Learning Engineer who love great food, new destinations, pop music on weekends and also NLP.  
I currently work for CBS Interactive in the Applied Machine Learning Group.  
I love sharing what I've learnt in research, but also the things I've picked up as an engineer, aka how to make things "work".
